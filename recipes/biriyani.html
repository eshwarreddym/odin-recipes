    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken biryani recipe features succulent, juicy pieces of chicken that are cooked 
        in a yogurt marinade and then layered with crispy onions, coriander, mint and basmati rice to give 
        you a dish that the entire family will enjoy. I've broken the process step by step and made a recipe 
        video for this chicken biryani so that you can make this restaurant style biryani at home!</p>
    
    <p>Biryani in India doesn't just mean biryani. There are variations across the length and breadth of the country.
         There is Hyderabadi biryani (which is what I'm sharing today) where the biryani has a lot of gravy or masala and
          is cooked slowly with rice in a sealed pot. Then there is the Muslim wedding biryani which actually has
           lesser masala, but packed with flavour mostly from whole spices; the Kerala biryani, donne biryani from Karnataka 
           and so many more.</p>
